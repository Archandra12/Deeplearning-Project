# DEFCON level Prediction using Deep Learning Basics
This project is created to practice deep learning basics to predict DEFCON level of country
## What is the project about?
Military conflict is an intense state of violence. In such situations, it is crucial for a nation to stay alert, cope with it, and mitigate its implications. The DEFCON system allows the nationâ€™s forces to be a step ahead of its rivals A country has set up the DEFCON (Defense Readiness Condition) warning system. Defense readiness conditions (DEFCONs) describe progressive alert postures primarily for use between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the commanders of unified commands. DEFCONs are graduated to match situations of varying military severity. DEFCONs are phased increases in combat readiness. It consists of five levels of readiness for the military forces to be prepared for the consequences of the conflict. In general terms, these are descriptions of DEFCONs:

-   DEFCON 5 Normal peacetime readiness
-   DEFCON 4 Normal, increased intelligence and - strengthened security measures
-   DEFCON 3 Increase in force readiness above normal readiness
-   DEFCON 2 Further Increase in force readiness, but less than maximum readiness
-   DEFCON 1 Maximum force readiness. 
**Objective:**  As part of this exercise we will use Deep learning to train our models on dataset which has all necessary features to predict the multiclass problem, DEFCON level required at a particular instance. We will analyse the data, train models, test their accuracies, verify their predictions. Main objective of this would be to use all the concepts required for ensuring the model predicts with best accuracy as DEFCON a mission critical task.

We will use the  [DEFCON](https://github.com/Archandra12/Deeplearning-Project/blob/data/defcon_level.csv)  Dataset and build a model to predict the DEFCON level for a given situation.
